# IS597_MLC
 IS-597: MLC course project 

1. The main notebook for executing is the [football_predictions.ipynb](https://github.com/sanmil09/IS597_MLC/blob/main/football_predictions.ipynb) in the root folder.
2. For this project we will be training a Linear regression model followed by ridge, lasso & polynomial regression and comparing model's performances:
   - Model 1 (Baseline model): All int columns and target variable.
   - Model 2 : Feature selected columns and target variable (log normalized)
   - Model set 3: Basic LR/ Ridge/ Lasso/ Polynomial regression

3. The dataset and metadata are located in the [Dataset](https://github.com/sanmil09/IS597_MLC/tree/main/dataset) folder.
4. Executing the whole scripts saves the images in [result/Analysis](https://github.com/sanmil09/IS597_MLC/tree/main/results/Analysis) Images and the two models in the [result/Model_results](https://github.com/sanmil09/IS597_MLC/tree/main/results/Model_results) folder.
