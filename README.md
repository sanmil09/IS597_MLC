# IS597_MLC
 IS-597: MLC course project 

The main notebook for executing is the football_predictions.ipynb in the root folder.
For this project we will be training a Linear regression model followerd by ridge, lasso & polynomial regression and comparing model's performances:
Model 1 (Baseline model): All int columns and target variable.
Model 2 : Feature selected columns and target variable.
Model set 3: Basic LR/ Ridge/ Lasso/ Polynomial regression

The dataset and metadata are located in the Dataset folder.
Executing the whole scripts saves the images in Result/Analysis Images and the two models in the Result/Models folder.
